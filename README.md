This project was prepared as an assignment for Manisa Celal Bayar University Software Engineering course.

The aim of the project is to design and implement a user-friendly interface for searching books from Gutenberg project and collecting the chosen books in a visual bookshelf for a specific user of the system. Every user should see his own bookshelf when logs in and he should be able to change the books in his/her own shelf by making new searches. Or he/she can simply remove one book from his shelf if the book is finished. The system should also keep track of the point/page where the user paused reading.

Since it was completed only to meet the requirements of the assignment and in a very short time (5 people working in parallel for 10 hours), some parts of the project (for example, keeping the user's password as a database MD5 hash) were not taken into consideration.

The project's other contributors are:

Yeşim Gürbüzer,
Gizem İpek,
Mert Boyaoğlu,
Eren Ersoyluoğlu.
